      "description": "Given a list of strings `words` and a string `pattern`, return a list of `words[i]` that match `pattern`. You may return the answer in any order. A word matches the pattern if there exists a permutation of letters `p` so that after replacing every letter `x` in the pattern with `p(x)`, we get the desired word. Recall that a permutation of letters is a bijection from letters to letters: every letter maps to another letter, and no two letters map to the same letter.",
